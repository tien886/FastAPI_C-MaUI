#ðŸš€ FastAPI_C-MaUI - C# MAUI (Frontend) + Python FastAPI (Backend)

FastAPI_C-MaUI is a simple cross-platform project demonstrating how to connect a .NET MAUI app (Frontend) with a Python FastAPI backend.

Module01 focuses on basic mathematical operations, allowing users to input four numbers and select an operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.) in the MAUI interface. The input is sent to the FastAPI server for computation, and the result is displayed in the app.
